$$   THIS TEST OK IN SSV1 - 06-JUL-1982
$$               AND SSV2 - 01-OCT-1986
$$
  $$ THIS PROGRAM DEFINES A HALF REVOLUTION OF A SOFT DRINK BOTTLE
  $$ TEN INCHES IN LENGTH, MILLS THE MALE SIDE OF THE SURFACE WITH
 $$  VERTICAL PASSES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE TO THE TOP
 $$ AND FINALLY TRANSCRIBES AN S SYMBOL ON THE BOTTLE SIDE
CLPRNT
$$--------------------------
$$  PLEASE NOTE THIS----     THE MINOR WORD XAXIS IS BEING USED
$$  IN THE SSURF/REVOLV DEFINITION INSTEAD OF THE WORD AXIS, WHICH HAS
$$  NOT YET BEEN LOADED INTO THE TRANSLATOR
$$  WHEN USING THE WORD AXIS,  IT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS THE WORD
$$  AXIS  ONLY.  IN THIS PROGRAM WE ARE USING A SYNONYM.

$$  BY THE POINTS 0,0,0 AND 1,0,0 (IE THE X AXIS) FROM THE ANGLE 0
$$ DEGREES TO 180 DEGREES.  THIS MEANS THE CURVE IS SWEPT FROM ITS
$$  STARTING POSITION CLOCKWISE THRU A ONE HALF TURN
$$  CLOCKWISE DIRECTION IS DETERMINED BY THE PROGRAMMER  PLACING
 $$  HIS EYEBALL AT 9999,0,0 AND LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRST
$$ POINT, 0,0,0.
